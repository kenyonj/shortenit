##URL Shortener
This is a super simple URL shortener. All you have to do is paste in your long
URL, press "SHORTEN" and you will be redirected to a page with the long URL
and the shortened version.

On the show page for your new shortened URL you can click the copy button to the
right of your short URL and the link will be copied to your clipboard.

###Bookmarklet
There is a customized bookmarklet that you can drag to your bookmarks bar for a
convenient way to create short URLs without having to copy and paste the URL
onto the jpk.io site.

Once you have the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar, all you have to do is
navigate to the page you wish to create a short URL for and click the
bookmarklet button.
